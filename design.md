# Design Roadmap

## Process

1. I analyzed the SUSE website for RMT and used color picker to fetch the brand colors (hexcodes)
2. I downloaded the SUSE branding (logo for header and footer) from the website
3. I used the latest web trends i.e. gradients for heading and card borders
4. I chose to keep the card styling minimal to avoid the word clutter 
5. I conditional changed the pill color to show whether the repository is enabled or disabled to improve the user experience
6. Header is sticky to improve user journey
7. The design is responsive on different browsers and devices

## Stack
Tailwind CSS was used to style the project. JavaScript is used with HTML to create the standalone web page.
